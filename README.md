Daily Reward System for Unity

This Unity script provides a versatile and customizable daily reward system for game developers. It allows players to claim daily rewards after a specified time interval. The script manages UI elements, tracks reward availability, and dynamically activates rewards based on progression. This makes it an ideal addition to games looking to engage players through periodic incentives. The key features include:

Flexible Integration: Easily integrate the script into your Unity project to implement a dynamic daily reward mechanism.

Reward Customization: Set the reward delay and assigned day to match your game's reward schedule. Customize the rewards to suit your game's needs.

User-friendly UI: The script manages the UI elements seamlessly, displaying claim and claimed states for rewards. The remaining time until the next reward is also shown to keep players informed.

Progression Control: The script automatically activates rewards based on player progression, allowing developers to design a reward sequence for increasing engagement.

Persistent Data: The script ensures data persistence by saving the last claim time and current day using PlayerPrefs.

Automatic Update: The script updates the remaining time continuously, ensuring that players are informed of the reward availability status in real-time.

Easy to Extend: The code is well-structured, making it easy for developers to extend its functionality or integrate it with other systems.
